//HOW TO USE:
/*
 * Implementation into a System:
 *  First, copy the definitions, the globals, the structs, all the help functions and the class with its source
 *  into your project.
 *  Then, call in the box() functions, the serial library functions of the serial library you want to use.
 *  If you want to use the protocol on more than one serial port (lib). Copy them and rename than for every library. Than 
 *  Create an object of the COM_LIB_FUN struct, with your box() functions.
 *  A great way to rename is to replace the serial in the name with the name of the library you use.
 *  Set the definitions the way you need them, default works good for all hardware serial, but depending how busy the other
 *  Arduino is, you may want to adjust the serial_max_com_response_time.
 *  Next, create a class object of the Serial_protocol class, using the constructor.
 *  Start the UART on the right baud rate with .begin().
 *  
 * Establish a new Communication type:
 *  First, pick a new request byte (for example 0x21). It can't be a defined byte and it can't be used before.
 *  Save it in the source code of the slave (REQUEST_BYTES_SERIAL struct)
 *  Send the request byte with one of the class functions in your main Code, whenever you need it.
 *  If you want to send additional data whit your request byte, you can do it whit those functions.
 *  Now you have to create a handle function in the slave Arduino and you have to list it in the callback function
 *  (serial_handle_functions_callback_list). Follow the rules, mentioned in the list function.
 *  If you want to send data, from the slave to the Master, give a callback function to the send_request() function,
 *  where you handle the incoming data. For example, save it in the global buffer. Check out the example functions for that.
 *  Callback functions must return if the received date was good or bad (bool, 1 is good).
 *  Make sure the UART buffer is empty when you end your callback function. For example, flush it. The class has a function for that.
 *  Last but not least, test if everything works fine.

 * -You need one function for every request
 * -The functions must return if the received data is without errors. 1 Yes / 0 NO
 * -If you don't receive data, you don't have to return anything
 * -If you receive data and send data in one function. Save your rx data in the serial_rx_buffer array and use it from there,
 *  otherwise it won't be there if the function gets called again after an error. Also, if you recognise an error in the incoming data,
 *  return 0 and don't send anything back. Furthermore, only in this case, the fist byte you send back, can't be an variable value.
 *  Check out the example in the Serial_Com_Def_Code to understand how to solve that.
 * -If you want to transfer data to your main code, use global values or the serial_rx_buffer array
 * -Make sure the handle function is as fast as possible
 * -Make sure the UART buffer is empty when you end your function. For example, flush it. The Class has a function for that
